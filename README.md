================
To run snow battle run snowbattle.py
It is a two player game and you must have at least one controller plugged in or it will fail.

To run the maze algorithm run maz_game.py
You can hit enter to redraw a new maze tile by tile as it is built by the algorithm.

My first attempt at a game.  Designed by my 5 year old and written in pygame.

So far all this program does is animate the generating of a random maze.
